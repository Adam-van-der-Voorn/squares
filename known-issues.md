#1, won't do
calculation of point gain is a bit incorrect regarding
tunnels of size 1-2 as they cannot be semi-selected

#2, won't do
it's unclear what to do if the we can get a tie by
semi-selecting

#3, TODO
we need to handle the fully closed case for the points gain
for the the inital tunnel we are semi-selecting

    player icon (redo line art, color)
